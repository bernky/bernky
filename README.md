You will not find me on any social media networks unless for employment purposes. If you have any questions about repositories or need help with a particular matter, do not hesitate to send an issue or directly email.

###### *Also, I will not heavily rely on github for any projects. All projects are backed up with heavy consideration outside of big tech. Gitlab, Bitbucket or a self hosted alternative if necessary.*
